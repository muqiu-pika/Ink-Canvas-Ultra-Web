# Integration & Presentation (PPT/WPS)

This page explains how Ink Canvas Ultra integrates with Microsoft PowerPoint and WPS.

## Quick Start

1. Open your PowerPoint presentation
2. Start slideshow (F5 or “From Beginning”)
3. The app automatically switches to slideshow mode for writing and annotation
4. Annotations are auto-saved and restored when reopening the same presentation

## Features and Options

- Show canvas on new slides: enable/disable in settings
- Stroke policies: clear or retain on page change; auto-save strokes and screenshots
- Navigation notifications: previous/hidden/autoplay pages
- Gestures and control: enable/disable two-finger gestures; finger-based slideshow control
- WPS support: adapted for WPS 2021 PPT mode

## Tips

- Enable “auto save strokes/screenshots” for complex sessions to review later
- Clear strokes before page change to keep layout clean when needed

## Notes

- PPTs in protected (read-only) mode are not annotated automatically
- Unactivated Office may cause crashes when turning pages; activate Office before use
- Running other whiteboard/annotation tools simultaneously may conflict; close them and retry
